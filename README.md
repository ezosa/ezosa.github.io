## About me

I am a PhD student/doctoral researcher in the Department of Computer at the University of Helsinki in Finland. My research is on NLP, specifically methods and models for analysis of multilingal news data. 

I am particularly interested in topic models for multilingual, diachronic, or multimodal data (or combinations thereof). I have done research on diachronic semantic change, multilingual news linking, and headline generation.
